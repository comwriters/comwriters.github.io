<h1 align="center">Welcome to the Communist Writers Association!</h1>

<h3 align="center">Home of the Journal of Socialist Research</h3>

The _Communist Writers Association_ has one main goal: the production of writings and research regarding socialist (in particular, Marxist) topics and concepts, ranging from locale class analysis to base theory and comments on other articles. The Association publishes the _Journal of Socialist Research_, a peer-reviewed journal containing writings and research from its members. It also writes resolutions formalizing many Marxist-Leninist-Maoist points using writings from those authors as well as dialectical analysis.
